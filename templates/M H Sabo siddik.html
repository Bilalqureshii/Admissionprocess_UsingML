        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Originally, the Institute was founded in the year 1936 as a trade school with the object of turning out
            artisans in some industrial arts and crafts. A major reorganization in its curriculum took place in the year
            1945. In 1958, a three-year Diploma program in Civil Engineering was started and five years later, two more
            Diploma program in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering were added. To cope up with the increasing demand,
            from 1981 the Polytechnic has increased the intake capacity from 120 to 180 students. Taking into
            consideration, the development in Industrial Electronics in Maharashtra and Mumbai in particular, the
            Polytechnic started three- year Diploma in Industrial electronics from the academic year 1981-82. From the
            academic year 1987-88, the polytechnic has started three Year Diploma in Computer Engineering. A three-year
            Diploma in Information Technology & Mechanical Engineering (Un-Aided) has been approved and sanctioned by
            AICTE, New Delhi from the year 2000-01, 2010-11 respectively. In the year 2000 the polytechnic was awarded
            as “Best Polytechnic with a cash prize of One Lakh” from Chief Minister, Govt. of Maharashtra.
            <br><br>
            In the year 2018-19 the polytechnic got NBA accreditation and based on the performance the aided seats were
            increased from 180 to 240. In line with this objective, the institute has assured the quality in technical
            education by continuous up-gradation of facilities and infrastructure along with the effort to appoint
            qualified & eligible teachers. We have ISTE chapter, CSI chapter for students.
