        <h1>CAP Round Information</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the CAP Round information page. CAP rounds are a crucial part of the admission process for many
            educational institutions. This page provides essential details about the upcoming CAP round, including
            dates,
            procedures, and guidelines.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check the allotment made in the CAP Rounds through candidate’s Login & verify the correctness of the
                credentials used in seat allotment made to him/her in CAP round I as per the Rules & Regulations</li>
            <li>Candidate shall ensure through login that his/her claims related to Qualifying Marks, category, gender,
                reservation, special reservation made by himself/herself in the application form are correct, and the
                relevant
                documents uploaded to substantiate his/her claims are authentic and correct.</li>
            <li>After ensuring the correctness of the allotment, candidates shall pay the seat acceptance fee through
                online
                mode for the purpose of accepting the allotted seat.</li>
            <li>Candidates who have been allotted a seat other than the first preference given by the candidate and if
                the
                candidate is satisfied with such allotment and does not wish to participate in further CAP rounds, such
                candidate can freeze the offered seat through candidate’s login. Such candidates shall then be not
                eligible for
                participation in the subsequent CAP rounds.</li>
            <li>Allotment is made to the candidate based on the claims made by him/her in the application form. If a
                candidate
                finds that the claim made by him/her is not correct during self-verification of the allotment, and if
                he/she wants to
                correct the error/discrepancy, (errors as per the clause (e) of sub-rule(4) of rule) the candidate shall
                report
                the grievance either by e-Scrutiny or Physical Scrutiny Mode without fail.</li>
            <li>In a later stage, if it is found that the seat allotted to the candidate is based on false claims made
                in the
                application by the candidate, then such allotment/admission taken in the allotted institute shall be
                cancelled
                automatically.</li>
            <li>Reporting date for admission in the allotted Institute: 29-07-2023 TO 04-08-2023</li>
